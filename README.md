# Weather-Analysis-Part-I
### Decision Making Based on the Investigation and Analysis of a Data Set using R

## Overview
This report contains an investigation of a data set to aid decision-making. The main objective of this report is to investigate the data set to determine with variables relate to Actual Temperature and Apparent Temperature.

## Dataset
The dataset contains weather data from the city of Szeged in Hungary obtained as a subset of large database available on Kaggle. It contains randomly collected weather data over a 10-year period that spans from the year 2006 to 2016. This amounts to 200 observations (sample of the larger population with over 96,000 observations), with one row of data per observation. 

## Data Description
Continuous Variables	Description
Actual Temperature - C	Temperature according to the thermometer
Apparent Temperature - C	How hot or cold it feels
Humidity – in proportion (0-1)	Moisture content in the air
Wind Speed – kilometre per hour	How fast the wind is moving per time
Wind Bearing - degrees	Direction from which wind is blowing (north - 360, etc.)
Visibility - kilometres	How far into the horizon one can see
Pressure - millibars	The pressure of the air
	
Categorical Variables	Description
Summary	Physical appearance of the weather
Precipitation Type	Form in which water is leaving the atmosphere towards the surface of the earth (e.g., rain, etc)
